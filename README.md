## User Stories

I utilised the agile MoSCoW prioritisation method while planning the user stories for this project. This aided the created of a MVP from the beginning and lends itself to be of an iterative development style. 

My user stories were categorised into epics and sub-divided into individuals tasks/acceptance criteria; details of which can be found on my [kanban board](https://github.com/users/ornao/projects/5). User stories were also ranked using MoSCoW prioritisation and were each given a sprint which gave me a timeframe to complete the majority of the tasks outlined in the user story. I did not submit specific dates for each sprint as this was my first time undertaking a project like and I was unsure how long individual tasks would take me to complete. I also generally had varying times each evening around work, however I generally gave myself a week and a half times for each sprint. Hence, I included must have for an MVP in my first sprint and categorised the rest of te user stories accordingly in later sprints.

**Epics** | **Explanation** | **Relevenat user story** |

## Design

### Theme

A [bootstrap template Yummy](https://bootstrapmade.com/yummy-bootstrap-restaurant-website-template/) was used for this project. I also utilised another [bootstrap template Admin](https://bootstrapmade.com/nice-admin-bootstrap-admin-html-template/) for the login/logout and forms of the site. I adapted and pulled aspects of the code for the website and changed CSS elements to better represent my vision for the glamping website.

### Colour 

I enjoyed the primary colours from the Yummy bootstrap theme (as mentioned above) and hence only changed the colours slightly from the original. I opted to replace the primary red colour with a magenta pink shade that complemented the visuals of my pictures. This subtle adjustment helped unify the elements of my website, creating a cohesive and visually appealing experience for visitors.

### Database

3 custom models were created for this project - accommodation, bookings and testimonials. My bookings model supports full CRUD functionality while accommodation and testimonials currently only pull from database. User model was provided for by django allauth. In future iterations, I would like to create an availability function in booking model to allow user to check if their desired accommodation is available for their desired dates. I would also like to include a contact model in future development so users have ability to directly contact site owner on site without having to ring or email separately.. I would also like to add more CRUD functionality to testimonials model so users can submit their own testimonials and 'like' different users reviews.

- user_id: AutoField (PK)

## Validation

### HTML - [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

The W3S HTML validator checks the HTML through the webpage url. This is because the validator does not recognise the django template language when HTML input directly into validator.

### Javascript - [JSHint](https://jshint.com/)
- The js included in this project is from the [bootstrap template Yummy](https://bootstrapmade.com/yummy-bootstrap-restaurant-website-template/). I did not adapt this code in anyway hence I did not try to fiddle with it and mess up its functionality by trying to fulfil all the validation checks. I only fixed the issues relating to missing semi-colons.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| When less than 3 bookings per user, bookings column appears squished into corner. This also appeared in confirm delete page.  | Removed d-flex of div of that section, this helped the display especially on larger screen sies. See [commit f7f98f4](https://github.com/ornao/pp4/commit/f7f98f448f9b3acc02061d16bfcfd2c2aa364f1e) and [commit 73f7ce1](https://github.com/ornao/pp4/commit/73f7ce1b1454e38038d58ad69283d78494a3d0d7) for further details. |

| Error messages where displaying for num_guests and accomodation_name even when criteria were met for form to submit  | Tested what was happening using print statements. Error was thrown as by testing not in statement true was printed even when actual value was selected - hence issue with type not the same. Hence, str(accomodation_name) is the same as ['Honeymoon Pod'] for example  See [commit 76df1ce](https://github.com/ornao/pp4/commit/76df1ce8567c972be503c708ef82b6a969f14334) for further details. |

## Future Bug fixes

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
|Confirm delete submit buttom does not match other buttons of website| check div classes and id to see what is inhibiting styling|


## Future development 
- Future development will include a form whereby customers can contact owners directly from site rather than having to email, phone separately.
- Double bookings are not an immediate threat to tthe booking system of this website as there are a number of pods/cabins of teh same type. The future availibility function will help show user what is available and what is not in due course.
